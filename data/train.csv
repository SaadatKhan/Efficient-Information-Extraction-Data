"What is the connection between HPV infection and cervical cancer?
 
All types of HPV can cause mild Pap test abnormalities which do not have serious consequences. Approximately 10 of the 30 identified genital HPV types can lead, in rare cases, to development of cervical cancer. Research has shown that for most women (90 percent), cervical HPV infection becomes undetectable within two years. Although only a small proportion of women have persistent infection, persistent infection with “high-risk” types of HPV is the main risk factor for cervical cancer.","['Asymptomatic', 'Cause of Cervical Cancer', 'Cause of Cancer']","[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"What is the connection between HPV infection and cervical cancer?
 
A Pap test can detect pre-cancerous and cancerous cells on the cervix. Regular Pap testing and careful medical follow-up, with treatment if necessary, can help ensure that pre-cancerous changes in the cervix caused by HPV infection do not develop into life threatening cervical cancer. The Pap test used in U.S. cervical cancer screening programs is responsible for greatly reducing deaths from cervical cancer. For 2004, the American Cancer Society estimates that about 10,520 women will develop invasive cervical cancer and about 3,900 women will die from this disease. Most women who develop invasive cervical cancer have not had regular cervical cancer screening.","['Cause of Cervical Cancer', 'Cause of Cancer']","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

What is HPV?Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a virus that infects the skin, genital area and lining of the cervix. It is spread during unprotected sex with an infected partner. There are many different types of papillomaviruses (about 100). Some types cause warts on the skin, some types cause warts in the anal and genital areas, and some types cause cancer.","['Sexual Spread', 'Cause of Cervical Cancer', 'Cause of Cancer']","[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

If you have large warts that have not responded to other treatment, you may have to have surgery to remove them.Some health care providers use the antiviral drug alpha interferon, which they inject directly into the warts, to treat warts that have returned after removal by traditional means. The drug is expensive, however, and does not reduce the rate that the genital warts return.Although treatments can get rid of the warts, none get rid of the virus. Because the virus is still present in your body, warts often come back after treatment.How can HPV infection be prevented?The only way you can prevent getting an HPV infection is to avoid direct contact with the virus, which is transmitted by skin-to-skin contact. If you or your sexual partner has warts that are visible in the genital area, you should avoid any sexual contact until the warts are treated.Research studies have not confirmed that male latex condoms prevent transmission of HPV, but studies do suggest that using condoms may reduce your risk of developing diseases linked to HPV, such as genital warts and cervical cancer. Unfortunately, many people who don’t have symptoms don’t know that they can spread the virus to an uninfected partner.What are possible complications of HPV and genital warts?","['Asymptomatic', 'No Cure', 'Sexual Spread', 'Cause of Cervical Cancer']","[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Human Papillomavirus (HPV)
 
HPV is a common virus that impacts both men and women. The HPV vaccine reduces the risk for HPV-related cancers. In the United States, each year HPV causes about 21,700 cancers in women and 15,600 cancers in men. HPV vaccination has been recommended since 2011 by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for both boys and girls. Kansas ranks among the lowest states when comparing HPV vaccination rates for adolescents nationally. The HPV vaccine series produces a higher immune response in preteens than older adolescents. To increase immunity to the virus before exposure, the ACIP recommends routine vaccination against HPV-related cancer and diseases for girls and boys at age 11 or 12 years.Kansans need your help to improve HPV vaccination coverage; HPV vaccine is Cancer Prevention!","['Cancer Prevention', 'Cause of Cancer', 'Rec-Children', 'Rec-Male Femle', 'Stance-Recommend', 'Source Credibility']","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]"
"What is HPV?
 
Genital human papillomavirus (also called HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI). There are more than 40 HPV types that can infect the genital areas of males and females. These HPV types can also infect the mouth and throat. Most people who become infected with HPV do not even know they have it. HPV is not the same as herpes or HIV (the virus that causes AIDS). These are all viruses that can be passed on during sex, but they cause different symptoms and health problems.","['Asymptomatic', 'Sexual Spread']","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"How do people get HPV?
 
HPV is passed on through genital contact, most often during vaginal and anal sex. HPV may also be passed on during oral sex and genital-to-genital contact. HPV can be passed on between straight and same-sex partners - even when the infected partner has no signs or symptoms. A person can have HPV even if years have passed since he or she had sexual contact with an infected person. Most infected persons do not realize they are infected or that they are passing the virus on to a sex partner. It is also possible to get more than one type of HPV. Very rarely, a pregnant woman with genital HPV can pass HPV to her baby during delivery. In these cases, the child can develop Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP), a rare condition in which warts grow in the throat. In children, this is also referred to as juvenile-onset Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (JORRP).","['Asymptomatic', 'Sexual Spread']","[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"Signs & Symptoms
 
Most people with HPV do not develop symptoms or health problems from it. In 90% of cases, the body's immune system clears HPV naturally within two years. But there is no way to know which people who get HPV will go on to develop cancer or other health problems. Sometimes, certain types of HPV can cause genital warts in males and females. Rarely, these types can also cause warts in the throat -- a condition called recurrent respiratory papillomatosis or RRP. Other HPV types can cause normal cells in the body to turn abnormal, and might lead to cancer over time. These HPV types can cause cervical cancer and other, less common cancers, including cancers of the vulva, vagina, penis, anus, and head and neck (tongue, tonsils and throat).","['Asymptomatic', 'Cause of Cervical Cancer', 'Cause of Cancer']","[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"The types of HPV that can cause genital warts are not the same as the types that can cause cancer. What are the potential health problems of HPV?
 
Genital warts usually appear as a small bump or groups of bumps in the genital area. They can be small or large, raised or flat, or shaped like a cauliflower. Health care providers can diagnose warts by looking at the genital area during an office visit. Warts can appear within weeks or months after sexual contact with an infected partner - even if the infected partner has no signs of genital warts. If left untreated, genital warts might go away, remain unchanged, or increase in size or number. Warts will not turn into cancer. Cervical cancer usually does not have symptoms until it is quite advanced, very serious and hard to treat. For this reason, it is important for women to get regular screening for cervical cancer. Screening tests can find early signs of disease so that problems can be treated early, before they ever turn into cancer.Other HPV-related cancers might not have signs or symptoms until they are advanced and hard to treat. These include cancers of the vulva, vagina, penis, anus, and oropharynx (cancers of the back of the throat, including the base of the tongue and tonsils).RRP causes warts to grow in the throat. It can sometimes block the airway, causing a hoarse voice or troubled breathing. Although rare, RRP can occur among adults and children.(September 21, 2011) CDC: Human Papillomavirus (HPV), What is HPV?

Because it’s often difficult to detect HPV, your doctor may look at the genital area or perform a HPV test (or Pap Test in the vagina).","['Asymptomatic', 'Cause of Cancer']","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
