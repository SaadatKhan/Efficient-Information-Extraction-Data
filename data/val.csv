infected, yet they can transmit the virus to a sex partner. Rarely, pregnant women can pass HPV to their
baby during vaginal delivery. A newborn that is exposed to HPV during delivery can develop warts in the

Most people with HPV do not know they have the infection. They never develop symptoms or health problems from it. Some people find out they have HPV when they get genital warts. Women may find out they have HPV when they get an abnormal Pap test result (during cervical cancer screening).

As this infographic shows, the HPV vaccine provides long-lasting protection against the most common cancers caused by HPV. (PDF)Doctors and nurses recommend the HPV vaccine for children at age 9.

CancerSome types of HPV can cause cervical cancer. Other types are associated with vulvar cancer, anal cancer, and cancer of the penis (a rare cancer).Most HPV infections do not progress to cervical cancer. If you are a woman with abnormal cervical cells, a Pap test will detect them. If you have abnormal cervical cells, it is particularly important for you to have regular pelvic exams and Pap tests so you can be treated early, if necessary.Pregnancy and childbirthGenital warts may cause a number of problems during pregnancy. Sometimes they get larger during pregnancy, making it difficult to urinate. If the warts are in the vagina, they can make the vagina less elastic and cause obstruction during delivery.Rarely, infants born to women with genital warts develop warts in their throats (laryngeal papillomatosis). Although uncommon, it is a potentially life-threatening condition for the child, requiring frequent laser surgery to prevent obstruction of the breathing passages. Research on the use of interferon therapy with laser surgery indicates that this drug may show promise in slowing the course of the disease.ResearchScientists are doing research on two types of HPV vaccines. One type would be used to prevent infection or disease (warts or pre-cancerous tissue changes). The other type would be used to treat cervical cancers. Researchers are testing both types of vaccines in people. ​","['Cause of Cervical Cancer', 'Cancer Prevention', 'Cause of Cancer', 'Prevent Spread']","[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

HPV vaccination is recommended at ages 11–12 years. HPV vaccines can be given starting at age nine years. Vaccines protect your child before they are exposed to an infection. That’s why we give HPV vaccination earlier, rather than later, to protect them long before they are exposed. Also, if your child gets the shot now (before they turn 15), they will only need two shots. If you wait until your child is older, they will need three shots. All preteens need HPV vaccination, so they are protected from HPV infections that can cause cancer later in life.

Tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap) VaccineThe Tdap vaccine protects your child against three diseases: tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (whopping cough). Tetanus is caused by a bacteria found in soil, dust and manure. Tetanus affects the neck and belly. This can lead to ""locking"" of the jaw so a person cannot open their mouth, swallow or breathe. Diphtheria is a very contagious bacterial disease that affects the respiratory system. The bacteria produce a toxin that can cause a sore throat, fever, and swollen glands in the neck. Pertussis is caused by a bacteria spread through direct contact when an infected person coughs or sneezes. After 1-2 weeks, pertussis can cause spells of violent coughing or choking, making it hard to breathe, eat or drink. This vaccine is a one time dose. Everyone should receive a dose of Td every 10 years.Learn more about the Tdap vaccine.Additional Resources:",[],"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine
 
What is human papillomavirus (HPV)?Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common virus that can cause cancers later in life. There are more than 100 types of HPV viruses. Some cause infection of the skin and others infect mucous membranes of various areas of the body. Different types of HPV infection affect the body in different ways. For instance, some types of HPV can lead to cancer of the tongue, tonsils, anus, cervix, vulva, and penis, and others cause warts in the genital area.What is the HPV vaccine?The HPV vaccine can prevent almost all HPV infections and protects against over 90% of cancers caused by HPV. HPV vaccine works best when given before risk of exposure and is most effective in pre-teens. Only two doses are required if the vaccine series is started before the 15th birthday.The HPV vaccine can help protect against 6 types of cancer: cancers of the cervix, throat, vagina, vulva, penis, and anus.It can also help prevent genital warts.Who can get the HPV Vaccine?Individuals ages 9-26 are eligible for the HPV vaccine.HPV vaccine produces the strongest immune response in preteens and works best when given between ages 9 and 12.What about people older than 26?HPV vaccination is not recommended for everyone older than age 26 years. Some adults age 27 through 45 years who were not already vaccinated might choose to get the HPV vaccine after speaking with their health care provider about their risk for new HPV infections and possible benefits of vaccination. HPV vaccination of adults provides less benefit, because more people in this age range have been exposed to HPV already.How many doses are there?People ages 9 through 14: two doses of the HPV shot are needed, 6-12 months apart.People ages 15 through 26: three doses of the HPV shot should be given over 6 months.Who should not get the HPV vaccine?People should not get the HPV vaccine if they:Have ever had life-threatening allergic reaction to any component of HPV vaccine, or to a previous dose of HPV vaccineAre currently pregnant. However, receiving HPV vaccine when pregnant is not cause for alarm. People who started a vaccine series before they learned they were pregnant should complete the series after the pregnancy. People who are breastfeeding may get the vaccine.People should talk to health care provider before getting HPV vaccine if they:Have severe allergies, including an allergy to yeastAre there any side effects?The most common side effects are mild and include:Pain, redness, or swelling in the arm where the shot was givenDizziness or fainting. Fainting after any vaccination, including HPV vaccine, is more common among adolescents. To prevent injury from fainting, adolescents should be seated or lying down during vaccination and for 15 minutes after getting the shot.NauseaHeadacheIs the HPV vaccine safe?Yes, the HPV vaccine went through extensive safety testing before being licensed by the FDA in 2006.
