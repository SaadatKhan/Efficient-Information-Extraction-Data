"Human Papillomavirus and Genital Warts
 
What is human papillomavirus?Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common causes of sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the world. More than 100 different types of HPV exist, most of which are harmless. About 30 types are spread through sexual contact. Some types of HPV cause genital warts single or multiple bumps that appear in the genital areas of men and women including the vagina, cervix, vulva (area outside of the vagina), penis, and rectum. Many people infected with HPV have no symptoms.There are high-risk and low-risk types of HPV. High-risk HPV may cause abnormal Pap smear results, and could lead to cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, or penis. Low-risk HPV also may cause abnormal Pap results or genital warts.Health experts estimate there are more cases of genital HPV infection than any other STI in the United States. According to the American Social Health Association, approximately 5.5 million new cases of sexually transmitted HPV infections are reported every year. At least 20 million people in this country are already infected.What are genital warts?Genital warts (sometimes called condylomata acuminata or venereal warts) are the most easily recognized sign of genital HPV infection. Many people, however, have a genital HPV infection without genital warts.Genital warts are soft, moist, or flesh colored that appear in the genital area within weeks or months after infection. They sometimes appear in clusters that resemble cauliflower-like bumps, and are either raised or flat, small or large. Genital warts can show up in women on the vulva and cervix, and inside and surrounding the vagina and anus. In men, genital warts can appear on the scrotum or penis. There are cases where genital warts have been found on the thigh and groin.Can HPV cause other types of warts?Some types of HPV cause common skin warts, such as those found on the hands and soles of the feet. These types of HPV do not cause genital warts.How are genital warts spread?Genital warts are very contagious and are spread during oral, vaginal, or anal sex with an infected partner. They are transmitted by skin-to-skin contact during vaginal, anal, or (rarely) oral sex with someone who is infected. About two-thirds of people who have sexual contact with a partner with genital warts will develop warts, usually within 3 months of contact.In women, the warts occur on the outside and inside of the vagina, on the opening to the uterus (cervix), or around the anus.In men, genital warts are less common. If present, they usually are seen on the tip of the penis. They also may be found on the shaft of the penis, on the scrotum, or around the anus.Rarely, genital warts also can develop in your mouth or throat if you have oral sex with an infected person.Like many STIs, genital HPV infections often do not have signs and symptoms that can be seen or felt. One study sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) reported that almost half of women infected with HPV had no obvious symptoms. If you are infected but have no symptoms, you can still spread HPV to your sexual partner and/or develop complications from the virus.How are HPV and genital warts diagnosed?Your health care provider usually diagnoses genital warts by seeing them. If you are a woman with genital warts, you also should be examined for possible HPV infection of the cervix.Your provider may be able to identify some otherwise invisible warts in your genital tissue by applying vinegar (acetic acid) to areas of your body that might be infected. This solution causes infected areas to whiten, which makes them more visible. In some cases, a health care provider will take a small piece of tissue from the cervix and examine it under the microscope.If you have an abnormal Pap smear result, it may indicate the possible presence of cervical HPV infection. A laboratory worker will examine cells scraped from your cervix under a microscope to see if they are cancerous.How are HPV and genital warts treated?HPV has no known cure. There are treatments for genital warts, though they often disappear even without treatment. There is no way to predict whether the warts will grow or disappear. Therefore, if you suspect you have genital warts, you should be examined and treated, if necessary.Depending on factors such as the size and location of your genital warts, your health care provider will offer you one of several ways to treat them.","['Asymptomatic', 'No Cure', 'Sexual Spread', 'Cause of Cervical Cancer', 'Cause of Cancer', 'Source Credibility']","[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

HPV (Human Papillomavirus)HPV or human papillomavirus is a common virus that can cause several cancers later in life.Nearly everyone will get HPV at some point in their lives. There are many types of HPV. Some types of HPV can cause life-threatening conditions such as cervical, oral and throat cancers. 14 million people in the U.S. get a new HPV infection each year, while nearly 40,000 people are diagnosed with a new HPV-associated cancer each year.How is HPV spread?You can get HPV through intimate skin-to-skin contact during sex, and a person with HPV can pass the infection to someone even when they have no signs or symptoms.How can I reduce my risk of getting HPV and the health problems it causes?Get vaccinated: HPV Vaccine is Cancer PreventionThe most effective thing individuals can do to reduce their risk of developing HPV-related cancers is to get vaccinated. All people ages 9 through 26 years, including boys and girls, are recommended to get the vaccine. The vaccine can also be given to some adults older than 26 years. The HPV vaccine is safe and has been proven to reduce and prevent HPV-associated cancers such as cervical, oral, throat, anal, penile, and vulvar cancers. Pleaseclick hereto learn more about the HPV vaccine.Get screened for cervical cancerWomen aged 21 to 65 years old should receive routine screening for cervical cancer. This can be done through a Pap test or HPV test. Pap tests should begin at age 21 and happen every 3 years. This screening will help identify early signs of cancer, which can lead to more effective treatment.Use protection when sexually activeUsing condoms the correct way during sex can lower the chances of getting HPV. However, HPV can infect areas the condom does not cover, which means the virus can still be spread even with condoms.Resources:HPV-associated Cancer InformationCancers Caused by HPVHPV Cancer InfographicOfficeAddressPhoneFaxSTD Prevention4815 W.

What is genital HPV infection?Genital HPV is a common virus that is passed on through genital contact, most often during vaginal and anal sex. About 40 types of HPV can infect the genital areas of men and women.While most HPV types cause no symptoms and go away on their own, some types can cause cervical cancer in women. These types also have been linked to other less common genital cancers— including cancers of the anus, vagina and vulva (area around the opening of the vagina).Other types of HPV can cause warts in the genital areas of men and women, called genital warts.How common is HPV?Approximately 20 million people are currently infected with HPV. At least 50 percent of sexually active men and women get genital HPV infection at some point in their lives. By age 50, at least 80 percent of women will have gotten genital HPV infection. About 6.2 million Americans get a new genital HPV infection each year.How do I get a genital HPV infection?The types of HPV that infect the genital area are spread mainly through sexual activity. Most HPV infections have no signs or symptoms; therefore, you might not know you’re infected, but you can transmit the virus to your sex partner.What are the signs and symptoms of genital HPV infection?The virus lives in the skin or mucous membranes and usually causes no symptoms. You can have visible genital warts or pre-cancerous changes in the cervix, vulva, anus or penis. Very rarely, HPV infection results in anal or genital cancers.Genital warts usually appear as soft, moist, pink or flesh-colored swellings, usually in the genital area. They can be raised or flat, single or multiple, small or large, and sometimes cauliflower shaped. They can appear on the vulva, in or around the vagina or anus, on the cervix, and on the penis, scrotum, groin or thigh. After sexual contact with an infected person, warts may appear within weeks or months or not at all.Genital warts are diagnosed by visual inspection. Visible genital warts can be removed by medication applied to the infected area. Other treatments are performed by a doctor. Some people opt for no treatment to see if the warts will disappear on their own. No one treatment regimen is ideal for all cases.How is genital HPV infection diagnosed?Most women are diagnosed with HPV from abnormal Pap tests. A Pap test is the primary cancer-screening tool for cervical cancer or pre-cancerous changes in the cervix. A test is available to detect HPV DNA in women. It may be used in women with mild Pap test abnormalities or in women 30 years of age or older at the time of Pap testing. The results of HPV DNA testing can help your doctor decide if further tests or treatment are necessary.No HPV tests are available for men.Is there a cure for HPV?There is no cure for HPV. But there are treatments for the health problems that HPV can cause, such as genital warts, cervical cell changes and cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina and anus.What is the connection between HPV infection and cervical cancer?Some types of HPV can infect a woman’s cervix (lower part of the womb) and cause the cells to change. Most of the time, HPV goes away on its own. When HPV is gone, the cervix cells go back to normal. But sometimes, HPV does not go away. Instead, it lingers (persists) and continues to change the cells on a woman’s cervix. These cell changes (or “precancers”) can lead to cancer over time, if they are not treated.A Pap test can detect pre-cancerous and cancerous cells on the cervix. Regular Pap testing and careful medical follow-up, with treatment if necessary, can help make sure that pre-cancerous changes in the cervix caused by HPV infection do not develop into life threatening cervical cancer. Most women who develop invasive cervical cancer don’t have regular cervical cancer screening.How can I reduce my risk for genital HPV infection?The only sure way to prevent HPV is to abstain from all sexual activity. Sexually active adults can reduce their risk by being in a mutually faithful relationship with someone who has had no other or few sex partners, or by limiting their number of sex partners. But even people with only one lifetime sex partner can get HPV, if their partner has had previous partners.It is not known how much protection condoms provide against HPV, since areas that are not covered by a condom can be exposed to the virus. However, condoms may reduce the risk of genital warts and cervical cancer. They can also reduce the risk of HIV and some other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), when used all the time and the right way.Where can I get more information?Visit theHPV Vaccinewebpage for more information.Visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’sSexually Transmitted Diseaseswebpages for more information on HPV.Cervical Cancer AwarenessNational Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health PromotionSTD information and referrals to STD ClinicsCDC-INFO1-800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636)TTY: 1-888-232-6348In English, en EspañolSymptoma GmbHCDC National Prevention Information Network(NPIN)P.O.

"What is the connection between HPV infection and cervical cancer?
 
A Pap smear can detect pre-cancerous and cancerous cells on the cervix. Frequent Pap smears and careful
medical follow-up, with treatment if necessary, can help ensure that pre-cancerous cells in the cervix
caused by HPV infection do not develop into life-threatening cervical cancer. The Pap test used in U.S.
cervical cancer screening programs is responsible for greatly reducing deaths from cervical cancer. The
American Cancer Society estimated that about 12,800 women in the United States were diagnosed with invasive
cervical cancer in 2000. In 2001, approximately 4,600 women will die from cervical cancer.","['Cause of Cervical Cancer', 'Source Credibility']","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

They may lead to cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, or penis. Others are called “low-risk” types, and they may cause mild Pap test abnormalities or genital warts. Genital warts are single or multiple growths or bumps that appear in the genital area, and sometimes are cauliflower shaped.
